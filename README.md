# Agenda

1) I'll give you a brief introduction to the codebase

2) We will work together to fix all the tests

3) Open up BUGS.md.  We'll discuss how to attack these and implement fixes.

4) You pick a new feature of your choosing to work on.  You can come up with your own idea or pick one from TODO.md.  It's OK if we don't fully finish the feature.
